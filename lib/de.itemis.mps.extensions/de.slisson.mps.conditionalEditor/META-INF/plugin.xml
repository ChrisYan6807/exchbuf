  <description>A conditional editor is almost like an aspect. It can be applied &quot;around&quot; existing editor, and whether it applies or not is determined by a condition and the applicable concept (similar to a pointcut in AO). Using this approach, it is now possible to essentially decorate any editor with any decoration based on arbitrary conditions.</description>
